# Birthday Organiser

Instead of suggesting a random date/time for an event and 30% of the people you want to come, cant come.
I'm going to try build something simple that captures when people are available for an event and then book something in the intersection of when everyone (hopefully) is available.

Couldn't easily think of a service that would let me do this and want to eventually migrate off facebook anyway so building something myself.
